## Babel presets
- Babel plugins that tell Babel what to look out for and
transform into plain, vanilla Javascript.

## Webpack.config
- The configuration is pretty self-explanatory. We require the
  html-webpack-plugin and then create a new instance of it, and set our
  skeleton HTML as the template. filename refers to the name of the HTML
  that the plugin will generate. inject body tells the plugin to add any
  JavaScript into the bottom of the page, just before the closing body
  tag.
