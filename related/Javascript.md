# Javascript
- ECMAScript - the specification, basically (TC39 group)
- Javascript, the language, as she is spoke
- move to yearly releases rather than monolithic releases
- [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015) (aka ES6) was the last "big" release. different browsers support different partial versions of it.

## Features
- ES6 modules obviate all that hellish Common.js / Require.js / AMD chicanery. Who would ever go back?! ðŸ˜¡
- [ES2015 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes); syntactic sugar around classic JS prototypal inheritance


## Concepts
- **Hoisting** - variable and function declarations are loaded into memory at compile time, so that functions can be called before they are declared (out of order.)
## Dialects

Static typing:

### Flow
- [flow.org](https://flow.org/)
- from Facebook, easily integrates with Babel
- [flow setup](https://flow.org/en/docs/install/s)

### Typescript
- [typescriptlang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- ([code](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals))
- from Microsoft
- popular among [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)+ devs
